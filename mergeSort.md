# Time and Space Complexity Analysis

A merge sort is done on the array to have the values sorted. Then the sorted array can be traversed, each time assigning the largest value to the largest free dimension. It is for this reason,
that dimension1 and dimension2 variables were created.

The merge sort algorithm was used because it has a runtime of O(nlogn).

The time complexity of the algorithm is mainly dependant on the merge sort algorithm which has a time complexity of O(nlogn)

The space complexity is O(n) as the sorting algorithm requires an extra array to be created (not in place)
